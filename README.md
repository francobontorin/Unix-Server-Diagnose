UNIX Server Diagnose
-

An audit defines a set of rules or configuration values you use to determine if the configuration of a server or group of servers match your organization’s desired compliance standards.
The UNIX Server Diagnose Script can compare a server’s configuration against the rules defined by the company, check that a configuration value meets the criteria specified in the template, or simply check to ensure that a specific value does or does not exist.

<b>Features<b/>

The key function of this Tool is enabling the ability to generate a Server Diagnose and Compliance Report on all supported Unix/Linux platforms (AIX, Solaris SPARC and RHEL) in a fully automated way.
It is displayed in the end of the script execution a detailed output showing the points that do not match the defined versions/standards, and/or the points missing for the box to become compliant.
 * Modular and function based script developed in Shell/Perl Script
 * Korn Shell Compliance (AIX/Linux/Solaris)
 * Flexible and Easy to support
 * It covers Hardware, Network, File Systems and Software’s verification
